	abstract={The issues of skill specificity and transfer of training were examined from an aptitude-treatment interaction approach. The current investigations extended A. M. Sullivan's (1964) approach by using a procedural transfer task and training conditions that differed in amount of training task practice and the degree of training task similarity to the transfer task. Two experiments were conducted with 232 college students. Experiment 1 examined the effects of a length-of-training manipulation on reasoning ability and transfer task performance relationships, and on the amount of transfer. Experiment 2 evaluated the effects of 2 training tasks that differed in terms of similarity to the transfer task on ability-performance relationships and the amount of transfer. Results suggest that Sullivan's approach partially generalizes to the acquisition of procedural knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract={Studied the influence of training in attention, observation and discrimination on other mental functions. Five trained and eight untrained Ss were examined regarding the accurate observation of some detailed features of words on printed pages. The Ss had to mark every word containing 2 letters 'e' and 's', until considerable improvement in speed and accuracy was attained. Accuracy was measured by the number of omissions, and by the proportion of the words marked, to those which should have been marked. For the trained Ss, a comparison of tests before and after training was made. Improvement in the function of observing and marking words containing the 2 alphabets was not equivalent to improvement in the group function of observing the make-up of words. Neither speed nor accuracy acquired in the training were equally applicable to other data. Suggestions for further study of the interdependence of mental functions are given.

	abstract={Examines the influence of training in the estimation of magnitude. A number of experiments were conducted on 6 Ss, who were tested on judgments of variations of size, weight and area. Results show that there was no inner necessity for improvement of one function, to improve others closely similar to it, due to a transfer of practice effect. In estimations of magnitudes in terms of unfamiliar standards, the acquisition of the new concept affected the judgment. Training might have also given ideas of how to most successfully estimate habits of making judgments in better ways. These habits might concern features in which the function trained and functions tested were identical. For similar functions and favorable cases for getting better standards and better habits of judging, the amount of improvement got by training in an allied function is small.
