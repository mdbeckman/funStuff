# Example Syntax
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Test Plot"}
plot(cars, pch = 016)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here's a citation of the article [@greenwade93], but Goossens wrote a book [-@goossens93].  If I want to cite both, I wonder what happens [@greenwade93; @goossens93].
